# Test double: _Spy_

## Introduction

Another not so known test double is the **Spy**. A spy is similar to a mock, in a sense that we can do assertions to its output. The main difference is that it keeps the original behavior of the function. It's useful to verify when something was called, without necessarily changing its implementation. (e.g. a side effect)

```js
const dog = {
  bark() {
    return 'woof!'
  }
}

function makeNoise(sound) {
  if(sound === 'loud') {
    dog.bark()

    return 'run!'
  }

  return 'ignore...'
}

it('the dog barks, when we make loud noises', () => {
  cosnt barkSpy = jest.spyOn(dog, 'bark')

  const result = makeNoise('loud')

  expect(barkSpy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(barkSpy).toHaveReturnedWith('woof!')

  expect(result).tobe('run!')
})
```

### ðŸ’¡ Good practices

- Whenever possible, prefer spies to mocks. This will ensure that the (original) code under test works as expected.

## Exercise

Still in the file `snippets/pets.js`,
there's a function `verifyPetBeforeAdopt`. To test it, we will need to spy some global methods such as `LocalStorage` and `events` in order to verify they were called as expected.

Some of the methods you'll practice:

- mock [`jest.fn()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions#using-a-mock-function)
- mock [`.mockReturnValue()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions#mock-return-values)
- expect [`.toHaveBeenCalledWith()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#tohavebeencalledwitharg1-arg2-)
- expect [`.toHaveBeenCalledTimes()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#tohavebeencalledtimesnumber)

**Test file:** `snippets/pets-spy.test.js`

## Bonus

### #1 Mocking the console

While developing, it is common to leave `console` logs (and warnings/errors) around, for diverse reasons. When it comes to running the tests, these logs may create unnecessary noise. The good news is that we can silence them using mocks!

In the same file, there's a function `searchPet()` that calls `console.log`. Go learn how to mock them in 3 different ways.
