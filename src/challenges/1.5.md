# Test doubles: Stub

## Introduction

When an external service needs to be mocked, we might be tempted to pass just the minimum data to comply with our test scenario:

```js
it('something happens, given a pet with profileURL', () => {
  getPetProfile.mockReturnValue({
    profileURL: 'link.com',
  })

  // act and assert that something is done...
})
```

Although functional, this approach has some cons:

- The data is not realistic (and probably incomplete);
- Harder to understand the real content context;
- Bugs might happen because of the missing data.

Go beyond dummy mocked responses. **A stub is a placeholder with realistic data.**

Stubs help you (and other developers) to:

- Get the full picture of what kind of data is expected;
- Implicit documentation about the method being used;
- Extra confidence by using realistic data;

```js
// Bad: Writing "foo bar" makes it hard for new developers
// to understand realistically what kind of data is expected
getPetProfile.mockReturnValue({
  profileURL: 'link.com',
})

// Good: With stubs, everyone can get a taste of the "real world".
// Usually stubs are a copy from a real request response.

// Using a sample stub directly
getPetProfile.mockReturnValue(petProfileStub.sample)

// Creating a stub variation
getPetProfile.mockReturnValue({
  ...petProfileStub.sample
  profileURL: 'pets/profiles/9120',
})
```

## Exercise

- **Test file:** `snippets/pets-metricsStub.test.js`
- **Run test:** `npm run test:challenge --at=pets-metricsStub`

In the last exercise, while testing `saveAsFavorite()`, we mocked `getPreferences()` with dummy data.

Your goal is to replace the response with a stub.
