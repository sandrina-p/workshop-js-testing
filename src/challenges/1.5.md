# Test double: Fake

## Introduction

Perhaps, this thought have crossed your mind:

> I'm mocking `[module-name]` to make things easier, but now I'm no longer totally sure that the integration with it works as expected.

A "fake" can mitigate this worry and give us some extra confidence.

Let's see a hypothetical scenario: Imagine a codebase where the module `account` to `getSettings()` is used a lot:

```js
// account.js
export function getSettings() {
  // A dummy possible settings
  return {
    notifications: false,
    secret: false,
    // ...
  }
}
```

The code that uses this module, has to mock `getSettings` returned value to comply with our testing scenarios. For example:

```js
// pagedetails.test.js
import { getSettings } from '/path/to/account'

jest.mock('/path/to/account')

it('does not show share button if account is secret', () => {
  getSettings.mockReturnValue({
    secret: true,
  })

  // Act on whatever needed...

  // Assert: The shareBtn does not exist!
  expect(shareBtn).not.toBeDefined()
})
```

So far, so good, right?

Now, let's assume `getSettings` was changed. The option `secret` was renamed to `private`.

Afterwards, we do a search for `getSettings` and replace `secret` by `private`. Unfortunately, some places migh escape us because we are humans after all. The tests are run and... this one passes because the `account` module was totally mocked! There's a silent bug going to production... 🐛

That's where a **fake** comes into action. **A fake is a simplified version of an original function.** A fake is like a smarter mock. Their main concern is to validate the arguments passed to the method and/or the returned dummy responses.

```js
// __doubles__/accountFake.js <-- Note the Fake suffix!

export function getSettingsFakeReturn(mockedResult) {
  // Extract all the expected keys from mockedResult
  // and thrown an error if some unexpected key was received
  const { notifications, secret, ...rest } = mockedResult
  const unexpectedKeys = Object.keys(rest)

  if (unexpectedKeys.length > 0) {
    throw Error(
      `getSettingsFakeReturn · The returned keys "${unexpectedKeys}" are unexpected.`
    )
  }

  return mockedResult
}
```

With this fake created, let's use it in the test:

```js
import { getSettings } from '/path/to/account'
import { getSettingsFakeReturn } from '/path/to/accountFake'

jest.mock('/path/to/account')

// Add getSettingsFakeReturn to the mock
getSettings.mockReturnValue(
  getSettingsFakeReturn({
    secret: true,
  })
)
// ...
```

When we re-run the tests, they will fail:

```bash
❌ 1 test failed: "hides share button if account is secret"

Error: metricsFake sendTrack · The keys "secret" are unexpected.
```

That's cool hein? Now we are more confident about mocks created.

We can create two different types of fakes:

- **Fake returned value:** What was just shown. The goal is to validate the mocked return is as expected.
- **Fake implementation:** The goal is to validate the args passed to the mocked function.

There's nothing wrong with having two versions of the same code. Extra work? Yes. But the effort is low, and definetely it pays off.

## Exercise

Let's improve the tests made to `pets.js` method.

Go there and update `sendTrack` and `getPreferences` mocks with the respective fakes. The fakes are already created, you just need to import and use them.

Once that's done, `getPreferences` will reveal a broken test (a silent bug was discovered)! Your goal is to fix the component and the test!

**Test file:** `snippets/pets-metricsFake.test.js`

Don't you know how to fix the bug? Go check `sendTrack` source code. You'll notice that it's expecting the key `special`. However, the component is sending a slightly different key. A typo needs to be fixed.
