# Initial expectations

## Introduction

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) has its reasons to be the number one choice for JS testing among web engineers. One of its strengths is the usage simplicity.
We'll start with exploring [globals](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api):

- Use `it()` or `test()` to create a single test method.

```js
// This test will run
it('works as expected', () => { ... })

// Only run this test
it.only('works isolated', () => { ... })

// This test won't be run
it.skip('will work soon', () => { ... })

// A test to implement later
it.todo('need to work on this')
```

- Use `describe()` to group related tests.
- Use [`expect()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect) to make assertions.

```js
// describe method can be nested
describe('quick-math', () => {
  describe('sumAll()', () => {
    it('returns the sum of all given numbers', () => {
      const result = sumAll(1, 2, 3)

      expect(result).toBe(6)
    })
  })
})
```

### 💡 Good practices

- A good test description should include 3 things:
  - What's being tested;
  - What's the scenario/conditions;
  - What's the expected result;
- Structure each test by the _AAA pattern_, which stands for _Arrange, Act & Assert_. This helps keeping the tests understable for everyone who will read them.
- Start with the simplest scenarios (happy path) first. Add more conditions and complex cases afterwards.

```js
describe('Animals', () => {
  it('A dog has one life', () => {
    // Everything "compacted" works fine, but it can get messy
    // to understand when applied in complex real-world scenarios
    expect(getPetDetails({ type: 'dog' }).lives).toBe(1)
  })

  it('A cat has 9 lives, when borned in Spain', () => {
    // Structuring with AAA makes it easier to understand
    // Arrange
    const type = 'cat'
    const country: 'spain'
    const livesNr = 9

    // Act
    const details = getPetDetails({ type, country })

    // Assert
    expect(details.lives).toBe(livesNr)
  })

  it('returns null, given a unknown pet', () => {
    // Arrange
    const filter = { type: 'tree' }

    // Act
    const details = getPetDetails(filter)

    // Assert
    expect(details).toBeNull()
  })
})
```

## Exercise

- **Test file:** `snippets/general.test.js`
- **Run test:** `npm run test:challenge --at=general`

In the file `utils/general.js`, there are two functions. Write the necessary tests for each one. Remember to:

- Write short but concise descriptions
- Start by covering the essential use cases.

Here's the custom script command to run the test:

## Bonus

### #1 Repetitive tests

While testing `getSinguralOrPlural`, you wrote (I hope) two similar tests, with different data. Using [`jest.each`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#testeachtablename-fn-timeout) allows you to write the test just once.

- Rewrite the tests for `getSinguralOrPlural` using `jest.each`.

### #2 Asserting dynamic results

In the same file there's a function `removeNullish()` that returns data as an `object`. How would we assert it?

Explore multiple assertion solutions besides `toEqual()`:

- Using [snapshots](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#tomatchsnapshotpropertymatchers-hint) (traditional and inline);
- Using flexible matchers. For example: [`objectContaining()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#expectobjectcontainingobject), `expect.any`, etc...

### #3 Code coverage

Jest comes with code coverage built-in, using [istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/).

By default the coverage report is disabled but it can be activated with the flag `--coverage`

- Run `npm run test:challenge --at=general -- --coverage`.
- In the project root, there's a new folder `coverage/Icov-report/index.html`. Open the file in the browser.
- Check out how's the report for `snippets/general.js`.

Did you manage it to 100%? Does it realy matter? We'll find out when we get back together!
