# Test doubles: _mock_

## Introduction

Another Jest core feature is [mock functions](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-function-api), which is one type of **test double** patterns. Before we dig into "mocks", let's first understand what a test double is.

A test double is **a simplified version of an original code implementation, used to reduce complexity.** They are a necessary trade-off to facilitate testing. In Javascript, we use 4 types of test doubles:

- Mock <!-- (check indirect output) -->
- Spy <!-- (check indirect output) -->
- Stub <!-- (control indirect output) -->
- Fake <!-- (control indirect output) -->

Let's start with the most known: **Mocks** allow us to replace the original behavior of a function with a dummy piece of code. With it, we can register when these functions are called and with what arguments.

```js
const sumMock = jest.fn()

sumMock(2, 3)

expect(sumMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(2, 3)

// ...

const getRandomMocked = jest.fn().mockReturnValue(100)

const result = getRandomMocked()

expect(result).toBe(100)
```

### ðŸ’¡ Good practices

- When creating mocks that are shared between multiple tests, remember to clear them between each test. This reduces tests coupling and prevents assertions bugs.

```js
// NOTE: Here, this is already added globally at jest.setup.js
beforeEach(() => {
  // Clears the amount of times a mock was called
  jest.clearAllMocks()
})

const sumMock = jest.fn()

it('1 + 2 = 3', () => {
  sumMock(1, 2)

  expect(sumMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
})

it('2 + 2 = 4', () => {
  sumMock(2, 2)

  // It was called just 1x because the mock was cleared
  expect(sumMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
})
```

## Exercise

In the file `snippets/pets.js`,
there's a function `petsGuard`. To test it out, you'll practice:

- mock [`jest.fn()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions#using-a-mock-function)
- mock [`.mockReturnValue()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions#mock-return-values)
- expect [`.toHaveBeenCalledWith()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#tohavebeencalledwitharg1-arg2-)
- expect [`.toHaveBeenCalledTimes()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#tohavebeencalledtimesnumber)
- expect [`.toThrow`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#tothrowerror)

**Test file:** `snippets/pets-mock.test.js`
