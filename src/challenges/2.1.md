# Testing Library

## Introduction

We might use Javascript to build web pages, but the end result is still the plain old HTML. That's the main outcome - The DOM. That's what we should focus on when testing UI applications.

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you. — Testing Library's guiding principle

**Testing Library** is a group of libraries that allows us to test the DOM in a way that's similar to how people find/interact with elements in the browser.

Besides enforcing _good practices_, it also comes with _accessibility in mind_. The final goal is to give us confidence in our UI code, even when refactoring it, without the headaches to maintain the tests.

For this workshop we'll use the following libraries:

- [`@testing-library/dom`](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/install) - The core DOM testing utilities
- [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom) - It provides custom DOM elements matchers for Jest.
- [`@testing-library/react`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) - React Testing Library (RTL) adds APIs for working with React components.

Here's a basic example using the core DOM:

The [Queries](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-queries#queries) are one of RTL's core features. It's how we access node elements in the DOM.

```js
import { screen } from '@testing-library/dom'

it('the button is disabled', () => {
  document.body.innerHTML = '<button disabled>Hello world<button>'

  // Use "screen" to access the document.body.
  // It comes with all TL queries variants
  const button = screen.getByText('Hello world')

  // The result from a query is a DOM element. You can access
  // it as you would do normally and assert it with Jest
  expect(button.getAttribute('disabled')).toBe('')

  // jest-dom provide us simplified queries.
  expect(button).toBeDisabled()
})
```

A similar example using a React component

```js
import { screen, render } from '@testing-library/dom'

const Button = ({ children, isDisabled }) => (
  <button disabled={isDisabled}>{children}</button>
)

it('the button is disabled', () => {
  // render appends the component DOM to the document.body
  render(<Button isDisabled>Hello world</Button>)

  const button = screen.getByText('Hello world')

  expect(button).toBeDisabled()
})
```

---

## Exercise

From now on, we'll be writing tests for the _Playground_.
We'll start with one of the simplest components, the `ActivityCard`.

Some of queries you'll practice:

- Query `getByRole`
- Query `getByText`.
- Method `fireEvent`.

**Test file:** `react/ActivityCard.test.js`

## Bonus

### #1 Asserting broken sentences

Write the test for `it.skip('tells when the activity is free')`.

You'll need to assert the sentence "For X people and it's free!". For this you'll need to use a Query with [`TextMatch`](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-queries#textmatch-examples).

```js
// Example
// <p>Hello World</p>

screen.getByText(/world/i) // substring match, ignoring case
```

<details>
  <summary>💡 Get Hint</summary>
  
  When a sentence is split into different nodes, the Testing Library can't find the sentence. Try using regex to look for a part, and then access the `parentElement` to check its `textContent`.

```js
screen.getByText(/it's free/i).parentElement
```

</details>

#### Bonus #2.1

We can also use a custom testing function to look for a full sentence. There's a `hasTextNode` built in this project. Go read it's source code to know more about the magic behind it!

```js
import { hasTextNode } from '../../playgrounds/snippets/testing'

const getFreeText = hasTextNode("For 3 people and it's free!")

expect(screen.getByText(getFreeText).toBeInTheDocument()
```

### Query emoji cheatsheet

This is my personal learning cheatsheet. Associating an emoji (🧠 visual) to each word has helped me to understand and memorize each query variant.

| Variant   | Explanation                                                |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| getBy\*   | 🎯 **Precise** - it fails when node doesn't exist          |
| queryBy\* | 🔍**Flexible** - it won't fail when node doesn't exist     |
| findBy\*  | ⏳ **Async** - it takes time. Will fail if nothing exists. |
| \*AllBy\* | 🗃 **Group** - The same as previous, but in a list (array)  |

```js
// 🎯 Precise - one button, it must exist, otherwise it fails
const button = screen.getByText('Add to favorites')

// 🔍 Flexible - useful to assert when something does not exist
const error = screen.getByText('Failed to load')
expect(error).not.toBeInTheDocument()

// ⏳ Async - it must be true, eventually
const success = await screen.getByText('Your message was sent!')
expect(success).toBeInTheDocument()

// 🗃 Group - The nodes are returned in an Array.
const movies = await screen.getAllByRole('movie')
expect(movies).toHaveLength(3)
expect(movies[0]).toHaveTextContent('Lion King')
```
