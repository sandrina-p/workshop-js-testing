# Async code

## Introduction

With Jest we can test asynchronous code in multiple ways. The following cases use `async` / `await`. Some main differences from traditional tests:

- The Jest global `it()` callback must be `async` so that we can use `await` inside.
- It's recommended to use `expect.assertion(number)` to tell Jest how many assertions are expected before finishing:

```js
// Success async call
it('should wake up eventually', async () => {
  expect.assertions(1)

  const result = await wakeUpAt(10)

  expect(result).toEqual('awake at 10:00!')
})

// Failed async call
it('should not wake up too early', async () => {
  expect.assertions(1)

  const promise = wakeUpAt(6)

  await expect(promise).rejects.toEqual({
    error: '6:00 is too earlier!',
  })
})
```

An async function's result can also be mocked using [`jest.fn().mockResolvedValue()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-function-api#mockfnmockresolvedvaluevalue).

```js
it('should wake up eventually', async () => {
  const asyncEventMock = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue('success')

  const result = await asyncEventMock()

  expect(result).toBe('success')
})
```

### Dealing with HTTP Requests

The [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) is a browser feature. Jest tests run in a Node environment. That means the tests will break when trying to execute `fetch`, because it does not exist in Node.

To solve that problem we need to mock `fetch`, which isn't an easy task. Luckily for us, there's the [`jest-fetch-mock`](https://github.com/jefflau/jest-fetch-mock) package that does that for us! (You can look at the package as a _fake_ - a simplified version of fetch).

```js
import fetchMock from 'jest-fetch-mock'

beforeAll(() => {
  // Creates the mock so that it can be asserted later
  fetchMock.enableMocks()
})

afterAll(() => {
  // Restore them to not affect other tests files
  fetchMock.mockRestore()
})

it('getRandomAnimal() returns a random fact', async () => {
  const fact = {
    fact: 'The average litter of kittens is between 2 - 6 kittens.',
    length: 55,
  }

  global.fetch.mockResponse(JSON.stringify(fact))

  const result = await getRandomAnimal()

  // Assert the fetch was called with the correct URL
  expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith('https://catfact.ninja/fact', {
    method: 'GET',
  })

  expect(result).toEqual(fact)
})
```

## Exercise

In the file `snippets/boredAPI.js`, there are a few functions that call a _real world_ API. It means that it deals with a real API that does HTTP requests to [The Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/) using `fetch`.

Your goal is to complete the failing tests.

**Test file:** `snippets/boredAPI.test.js`

### Before you get started...

I want to share one last thing: In the test file there's an imported module `activityStubs`. What's a better way to learn what a stub is than to see (and use) one directly?

Once you open the file, you'll see the following:

```js
export const activityStubs = {
  basic: {
    activity: 'Write a note of appreciation to someone',
    type: 'social',
    participants: 1,
    price: 0,
    link: '',
    key: '1770521',
    accessibility: 0,
  },
  // ...
}
```

**A stub is an object with realistic data.** Usually used as a result of a _mocked function_ to test a specific scenario. I love stubs because they help me (and you) understand the kind of information that is expected from a function. In this exercise, use them to write more realistic tests to `boredAPI`.

```js
// Bad: Writing "foo bar" makes it hard for new developers
// to understand realistically what kind of data is expected
global.fetch.mockResponse(
  JSON.stringify({
    activity: 'hello world',
    key: 'foo',
  })
)

// Good: With stubs, everyone can get a taste of the "real world".
// Usually stubs are a copy from a real request response.
global.fetch.mockResponse(JSON.stringify(activityStubs.basic))
```

## Bonus

### #1 Mock Service Worker

A possible step further when dealing with HTTP is [msw](https://github.com/mswjs/msw). There are some key differences from `jest-fetch-mock`:

- The `fetch` is not mocked. Instead it creates a "mocked" service worker to intercept the requests.
- It supports both `REST` and `GraphQL`.
- The mocks created can live alongside the rest of the app. It can be used for development, unit testing and E2E testing!

That sound promising, uh?

The setup and most of the tests using `msw` are already done for you. Your goal here is just to read directly `boredAPI-msw.solution.test.js` and get to know how it is done. There are still a few `it.todo()` left to be done. You can do them!

If this rings any bell to you, I highly recommend you to read [Stop Mocking fetch](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-mocking-fetch).
