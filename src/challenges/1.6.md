# Test doubles: Fake

## Introduction

Perhaps, this thought has crossed your mind:

> I'm mocking `[module-name]` to make things easier, but now I'm no longer fully sure if the integration with it works as expected.

A _fake_ can mitigate this worry and give us some extra confidence.

Let's see a hypothetical scenario: Imagine a codebase where the module `account` to `getSettings()` is used a lot:

```js
// account.js
export function getSettings() {
  // A dummy possible settings
  return {
    notifications: false,
    secret: false,
    // ...
  }
}
```

The code that uses this module has to mock the `getSettings`'s returned value to comply with our testing scenarios. For example:

```js
// pagedetails.test.js
import { getSettings } from '/path/to/account'

jest.mock('/path/to/account')

it('does not show share button if account is secret', () => {
  getSettings.mockReturnValue({
    secret: true,
  })

  // Act on whatever needed...

  // Assert: The shareBtn does not exist!
  expect(shareBtn).not.toBeDefined()
})
```

So far so good, right?

Now, let's assume `getSettings` was changed. The option `secret` was renamed to `private`.

Afterwards, we do a search for `getSettings` and replace `secret` with `private`. Unfortunately, some places might go unnoticed because we are humans after all. The tests are run and... this one passes because the `account` module was totally mocked! There's a silent bug going to production... üêõ

That's where a fake comes into action. **A fake is a simplified version of an original function, a smarter mock.** Their main goal is to validate the arguments passed to the method or the returned dummy responses.

```js
// __doubles__/accountFake.js <-- Note the Fake suffix!

// Validates the mockedResult is as expected
export function getSettingsFakeReturn(mockedResult) {
  // Extract all the expected keys from mockedResult
  // and thrown an error if some unexpected key was received
  const { notifications, secret, ...rest } = mockedResult
  const unexpectedKeys = Object.keys(rest)

  if (unexpectedKeys.length > 0) {
    throw Error(
      `getSettingsFakeReturn ¬∑ The returned keys "${unexpectedKeys}" are unexpected.`
    )
  }

  return mockedResult
}
```

With this fake created, let's use it in the test:

```js
import { getSettings } from '/path/to/account'
import { getSettingsFakeReturn } from '/path/to/accountFake'

jest.mock('/path/to/account')

// Add getSettingsFakeReturn to the mock
getSettings.mockReturnValue(
  getSettingsFakeReturn({
    secret: true,
  })
)
// ...
```

After running the test again, we'll get the error:

```bash
‚ùå 1 test failed: "hides share button if account is secret"

Error: metricsFake sendTrack ¬∑ The keys "secret" are unexpected.
```

That's cool, right? Now we are more confident about the mocks created.

We can create two different types of fakes:

- **Fake returned value:** The goal is to validate the mocked return value. (shown above)
- **Fake implementation:** The goal is to validate the args passed to the mocked function and if needed, return something based on the arguments.

There's nothing wrong with having two versions of the same code. Extra work? Yes. But the effort is low and it definitely pays off.

## Exercise

- **Test file:** `snippets/pets-metricsFake.test.js`
- **Run test:** `npm run test:challenge --at=pets-metricsFake`

In the tests previously made to `saveAsFavorite()`,
the module `metrics` was totally mocked.

Your goal is to update the `sendTrack` and `getPreferences` mocks with the respective fakes. The fakes are already created, you just need to import and use them.

**Test file:** `snippets/pets-metricsFake.test.js`
