# RTL: React Context

## Introduction

When we create a React Context that can be used (consumed) by a large amount of components, it's a good idea to test its funcionality, untied from a component.

Unfortunately, there isn't any out-the-box way to test Context in a totally isolated way. The best current solution is to create a "Checkup" component that servers as bridge between the Context and the actual DOM output.

```js
import { ThemeContext, useThemeContext } from 'path/to/ThemeContext'

function ThemeCheckup() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useThemeContext()

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Theme: {theme}</p>
      <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle theme</button>
    </div>
  )
}

it('the theme is light by default', () => {
  render(
    <ThemeContext.Provider>
      <ThemeCheckup />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )

  const themeText = screen.getByText('Theme:')

  expect(themeText).toHaveTextContent('Theme: light')
})
```

```js
it('it accepts a custom theme', () => {
  render(
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme: 'dark' }}>
      <ThemeCheckup />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )

  const themeText = screen.getByText('Theme:')

  expect(themeText).toHaveTextContent('Theme: dark')
})

it('toggling the theme switches between light and dark', () => {
  render(
    <ThemeContext.Provider>
      <ThemeCheckup />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )

  const getTheme = () => screen.getByText('Theme:').textContent
  const getBtn = () => screen.getByText('Toggle theme')

  // Assert #1 - it's light
  expect(getTheme()).toBe('Theme: light')

  // Act + Assert #2 - it's dark now
  fireEvent.click(getBtn())
  expect(getTheme()).toBe('Theme: dark')

  // Act + Assert #3 - it's light again!
  fireEvent.click(getBtn())
  expect(getTheme()).toBe('Theme: light')
})
```

### 💡 Good practices

- Avoid the temptation of asserting implementation details of a React Context. There's also a way to reflect the ouput in a node element.

## Exercise

The Playground app has a context. It's called `BoredContext`. A initial test is already done, but some are still missing. Your goal is to finish the incompleted tests.

**Test file:** `react/BoredContext.test.js`

#### Choices:

- **Stubs:** Remember to go beyond _foo data_. There's a module with `activityStubs` (already imported) ready to be used, if you want to!
- **Dependencies:** Will you mock `boredAPI` and just assert that `getNewActivity` was called? Or will you use the original module and assert directly the `fetch` request (as we did at `1.6`)? Mocking the module is slightly easier. Asserting the fetch gives you extra confidence. Two options, your choice!

## Bonus

### #1 Using custom wrapper

Probably you duplicated `BoredProvider` across all the renders:

```js
render(
  <BoredProvider>
    <ConsumerCheckup {...customProps} />
  </BoredProvider>
)
```

You can create a custom wrapper using the `wrapper` option to `render`.

```js
const renderBored = (ui, opts) =>
  render(ui, {
    wrapper: props => <BoredProvider {...props} {...opts.providerProps} />,
    ...opts,
  })

// Simple usage...
renderBored(<ConsumerCheckup />)

// Or passing props to the provider:
renderBored(<ConsumerCheckup />, {
  providerProps: {
    value: {
      done: ['001', '002'],
    },
  },
})
```

This is useful when most of your components rely on a higher context, (eg a `ThemeProvider` for CSS-in-JS tools). Check out [Testing Library example](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/setup#custom-render)

### #2 Creating `BoredProviderFake`

The same way this Context is consumed by a lot of components, it's natural if developers choose to mock it, especially if they want to assert side effects (eg a dispatch was called). That's when a fake is useful.

It's already done. Go check its source code at `__doubles__/BoredContextFake.js`. In future exercises, you'd use it like this:

```js
it('calls clear on mount', () => {
  const dispatch = {
    skippedClear: jest.fn(),
  }
  render(
    <BoredProviderFake state={state} dispatch={dispatch}>
      <MyComponent />
    </BoredProviderFake>
  )

  expect(dispatch.skippedClear).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
})
```
