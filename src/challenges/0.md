Hi there, welcome! 👋

You are almost ready for a session packed with knowledge! This website contains all the materials needed for the workshop.

🚧 **This is WIP, pull the latest changes before the workshop day!** 🚧

Access [JS Testing slides](TODO-LINK) for a theoric complement to this learning journey.

We'll talk and practice the following topics:

### Challenges notes:

- All the external packages that we'll talk about are already installed and configured. You just need to use them directly.

- You won't write all the needed tests for each file. Instead, I'll point you to some _strategic tests with the biggest learning value_. Here's how you'll know if you should, or not, write a test:

```js
// 🍀 Test to be done:
it.todo('must work')

// 🍀 Test to be done:
it('will work', () => {
  // This gives you an idea how many assertions you should do
  expect.assertions(3)

  // The lucky emoji 🍀 will guide you
  // The light bulb emoji 💡 has tips & tricks
})

// 😴 Extra time? Go ahead and complete the skipped tests
it.skip('will work', () => {
  // ...
})
```

- There are a few script to help you running the tests for a given challenge:

```bash
# Run exercise with file name "general.test.js"
npm run test:challenge --at=general

# Run the respective solution
npm run test:solution --at=general

# Run both the exercise and solution
npm run test:both --at=general
```
